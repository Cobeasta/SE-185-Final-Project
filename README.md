This is the final project for our SE185 group.

The process for editing the git repo is the following:

1. Clone the repository locally - this creates a local copy of the project on your computer.
2. Create a branch from the master branch - this creates a working copy to make changes for. Use branches for small changes in the code.
3. Add any new files to git and commit whatever changes you make to this branch. If a branch takes multiple days make sure to push your progress to the remote repo.
4.  create a pull request once you are finished.
5. Someone will review the pull request and merge the branch with master after making sure the changes work.
6. Once the branch is merged, remove it and make a new one for your next issue.
